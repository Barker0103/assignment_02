### Discussion on librry resources
Please respond to the following questions using about four (4) sentences for each. Please be sure to remove the `TODO` tags on each line as you work.


 - Which resources or services of the library did you research? Why were you attracted to these ones?

The library service that I researched are the glass private rooms. I was attracted to this service because I think it will really help me study when I need to. It is a quiet room that can be used by yourself or with friends. If you need to study with friends, this is the place to do it. I also researched the selection of books and the tutor sessions in the library.

 - Which one resource or service do you think would be especially important to your studying process? In your discussion, please reflect on how the absence of this particular resource or service would be detrimental to your scholarship?

The service that would be important to my studying process would be the glass rooms in the library. If this wasn't a thing in the library, there wouldn't be a place to study where it was completely quiet and secluded. There wouldn't be a place in the library that I could reserve as my own space and it was a guarantee that I would be alone. It lets people have their own space to think and study.

 - Who else can benefit from this resource or service and why? Please reflect on what kinds of problems can be resolved by its use.

Any student at Allegheny can benefit from this resource. It is free for all students at all hours that the library is open. All you have to do is sign up for hours on the sign up sheet outside the room. These rooms can help students study and be alone in a quiet space.

 - How does the library maintain this resource or service? For instance, is it free or is there some cost necessary?

The library makes sure that these rooms are clean for our use. It is completely free for any students use. There is no cost and any student can walk in whenever they want and use the room at their dispense. The rooms are open whenever the library's hours are open.

 - Are there any disadvantages associated with this resource or service?

In my opinion, there are no disadvantages to this resource. It is not required for the students to use. It is completely free for them to use whenever they want. Lastly, it is one of the best places to study on campus which is a necessity in college.
